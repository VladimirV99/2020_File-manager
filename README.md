## About

This is an implementation of a file manager for Android. It includes launchers for basic file types like text, image, audio and video files. Other files can be opened using appropriate apps installed on the system. The app supports two themes: light and dark which can be set manually or using the system dark mode on Android 10+
The app is written in the Kotlin programming language, and uses [Google Material](https://material.io/develop/android/) and [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) libraries for ui design, navigation and some useful layout components.

## Installation

The app supports all versions of Android after version 4.4. The latest version can be downloaded from the GitHub Releases section. Because the app isn't signed, to install it you need to enable installation of apps from unknown sources in the phone settings.
